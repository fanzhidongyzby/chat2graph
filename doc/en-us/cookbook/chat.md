## 1. Interface Overview

The main interface is divided into three primary sections:

* **Left Sidebar:** Contains conversation management options and history.
* **Main Chat Area:** Displays the ongoing conversation and the status of your requests.
* **Input Area:** Where you type your instructions and select the expert mode.

* **Graph Display:** During the process of operating the graph database with Chat2Graph, it can even render the involved graph, providing a very good visualization feature.
